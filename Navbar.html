                    The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than
                    Earth's Moon.<br>

                    The Latest<br>
                    Full Moon Guide: January - February 2022<br>
                    From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when
                    viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity
                    to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby
                    Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.<br>

                    Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise
                    briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in
                    reverse at sunset.

                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the
                    four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar
                    in size and density. These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between
                    the two worlds.<br>

                    Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in
                    thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It’s
                    the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface
                    temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt
                    lead. The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands
                    of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active.<br>

                    Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to the
                    pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.

                    While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar
                    system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the
                    biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.<br>

                    The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after
                    Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means
                    “the ground.” </p>

                    Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than
                    twice as massive as all the other planets combined.<br>

                    Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating
                    in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger
                    than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years. </p>
